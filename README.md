Spring Boot Assessment


●  	What did you like about this project?
We get to recap on our HTML, CSS, JavaScript, which I forget how to do it! 

●  	What did you struggle with in this project?
I have been trying for million years to figure what's the error - TypeError: Cannot set properties of null(setting 'innerHTML') or Error 405. 
Probably also because of the date, as I didn't convert it to String or utilize the Date package, so the client server cannot capture the HTTP request? Hence, I am unable to add task through my to do form!

●  	What would make your experience with this assessment better?
By resolving the error, and continue to work on the code.
